An interactive Manim builder, where you can build your animations visually rather than having to code :) 

Here is something I made recently, the code is all automatically generated from the system and none of it needed coding experience - think of it like Adobe Animate.

This should lessen the knowledge barrier to get started and make the learning curve less steep for any newcomers.

It supports:
- Transformations, movement, changing mobject, scaling, colours
- Grouping
- complex data structures such as trees
- markuptext, latex (mathtex)
- playing multiple animations, looping (repetitions)
- previewing the animation 
- exporting the animation into automatically generated Python code.

Everything is open-source so feel free to check out the code : https://github.com/kevcen/manimate
